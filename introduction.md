# Introduction to Multimodal Composition
Multimodal composition is...

The best way to think about it is look at some examples:

## How to make America Great Again!

I chose this meme as my form of multimodal composition. Because multimodal composition may be presented in the form of 3D images with text, I felt memes would be the most suitable example. This particular meme Is an example of one of many useful ways memes can present a form of expression and communication quick, concise, and effectively. 

## Under our Skin

For my multimodal composition example, I chose Under Our Skin by the Seattle Times interaction team. I find this composition extremely interesting and engaging because how its incorporates text, video, audio, and interactivity. When you scroll down the article they're buttons that will take you to certain videos. Each video corresponds to interviews of people talking about what specific race-related terms mean to them. Underneath this video player, the team put a text box for the reader to submit their thoughtful responses. The text box gives the reader a chance to think about what the people in the interviews are saying and have their own personalized response to the terms. As of right now, I do not have a topic for my multimodal composition, but I really like the layout of Under Our Skin and would want something with similar interactivity. 

## Seve Deadly Sins

Seven Digital Deadly Sins uses audio, visuals, traditional text elements, and personal interviews to create a truly multimodal experience for the viewer of the documentary. The fact that it's a website with interactive content such as surveys, takes it one step further, making it truly multimodal by provoking thought through a non-traditional mode of interaction with the content.

## Statoil Website

I chose this particular example of multimodal composition for a few different reasons. I am extremely interested in this company and how it is attempting to reconcile being a multinational oil and gas company while also investing in and innovating technology to mitigate their carbon footprint through carbon capture technology. In terms of composition, I am a huge fan of their website interface and architecture. Their site is clean, modern, multimodal and intuitive. The textual and rhetorical composition fits extremely well with the aesthetic of the website which creates a user-friendly experience for audiences that may not be familiar with Statoil. Videos, images and news articles are easily viewed and laid out within the page flow of the site. This website is an example of the type of composition that I strive for in my design work. 

## Collage

I selected a collage because the ways of communicating are endless as far as creativity goes. There are so many types of ways to put text through words and images that can make a person read an essay in a new light. Collages are a form of art that usually are put together to communicate a certain message to express individuality from the creator as well. There are trends that combine paintings, literature, graphics and photography which leaves room thinking outside the box.
